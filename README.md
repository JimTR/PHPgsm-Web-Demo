# PHPgsm Demo Web Interface
Web Build
<p>This software is example code to be used with the PHPgsm API as a web interface. To that point it has no other use unless you are using the API.</p>
<p>The code is currently, very fluid and changes are made very quickly so if you find something doesn't work on the version you cloned just re pull the most up to date version.</p>
